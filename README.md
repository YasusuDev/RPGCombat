# RPGCombat

Overview

This project is a study of advanced AI combat mechanics in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. It leverages the Gameplay Ability System (GAS), Behavior Trees, AI Perception, Motion Warping, and Damage Effects to create a dynamic and engaging AI system for RPG combat scenarios.

Features

AI Perception System: Enables enemies to detect and react to players and other entities.

Behavior Tree (BT) AI Logic: Implements decision-making and combat strategies.

Gameplay Ability System (GAS): Handles AI abilities, damage application, and effect management.

Melee Combat System: AI can engage in close-range combat with dynamic attack behaviors.

Motion Warping: Enhances AI movement fluidity and responsiveness.

Target Awareness & Decision Making: AI evaluates the threat level of different targets.
